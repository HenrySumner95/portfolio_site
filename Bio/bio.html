			Let's start with education. I aquired a bachelors degree in computing
			at Demontfort University in Leicester, England. My major field of study was in data analytics, bolstered by several research and 
			decision-making modules. I developed a genuine love for finding out cool stuff using data, and I haven't looked back since.
			<br>
			<br>
			Since graduating in 2016, I've worked in several roles as a data analyst, almost exclusively specializing in pricing, and now hold
			the position of Senior pricing analyst.
			<br>
			<br>
			Throughout my career, I've had the privilage of being exposed to many exciting technologies that have helped to expand my repetoire
			 of data science skills. At the top of the list, my true love, Python.
			<br>
			<br>
			In my spare time, when I'm not watching Netflix, I like to make stuff on the internet. My obsession started in secondary school, when I was 14. 
			One day, I decided to take out my dad's old VHS video camera, and I made a video diary to share with my fellow drama class students.
			What I intended to be an informative video for my peers ended up being an accidental comedy hit across the school year. I made dumb
			5 minute videos about anything I could think of for the next 4 years, and I loved every second of it.
			<br>
			<br>
			I now create educational Youtube videos, using the analytics and research skills I have spent years developing. Though my production
			rate is painfully slow, I hope to perfect this process and build an audience of followers who can learn about subjects through the
			power of empirical research and data analysis.
			<br>
			<br>
			Despite my typical English upbringing, I decided to indefinitely leave the United Kingdom, and I now reside in Munich, Germany, 
			where I'm loving life. Good beer, mountain hiking, and fantastic public transit is all a proper English man could hope for.
